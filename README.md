# Hexxing Hunt
Hexxing Hunt is a split screen hide and seek style game, a la "Prop Hunt" or "Screencheat". The goals are simple. As the witch: survive. As the witch hunter: find that witch, and BURN THEM.

This game was made by Studio GJTW in the Unity engine, for our 2D Game Design class at MICA (Maryland Institute College of Art).
